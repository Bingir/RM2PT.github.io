## Background
RM2PT was originally developed by Dr.Yang when he was pursuing a Ph.D. degree at the University of Macau and UNU-IIST with Prof. Xiaoshan Li and Zhiming Liu. Currently, RM2PT is continuously being developed and maintained by his group in [School of Software](http://soft.buaa.edu.cn) and [Software Engineering Institute](http://sei.buaa.edu.cn) at Beihang University (BUAA). RM2PT has being extended from serval directions: Requirements Modeling, Verification, and System Generation and collaboration with Universities and Company such as GXNU, ECNU, and BJUT.

## BUAA Group
BUAA group focus on Automatic Software Engineering such as Models Transformation and Code Generation.

- Yongqi Pu (Goal2UML) (Co-supervised with Tong Li (BJUT))
- Yiming Zhu (RM2PT Process Life)
- Yihui Jian (RM2PT for Industrial Software) (Co-supervised with Zhang Li (BUAA))
- Peiye Yang (State Machine with Simulation) (Co-supervised with Zhang Li (BUAA))
- Zhaotian Li (Services Classification)

## GXNU Group
RM2PT is being integrated with Problem Frames for CPS requirements modeling with Prof. Li's Group in Guangxi Normal University.
GXNU group focuses on model transformation between Problem Frames and UML-based Requirements Model, Enterprise System Generation from requirements model,

- Shaohong Zhu (RE2EIS)
- Jie Deng (PF2UML)

## ECNU Group
RM2PT is being enhanced by Formal Methods with Prof. Li and Zhao's group at East China Normal University. ECNU groups focus on  JML-annotated Prototype Generation and Consistency proof by verifying transformation rules of RM2PT
