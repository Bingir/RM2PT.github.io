## Introduction

EclEmma is a free Java code coverage tool for Eclipse, available under the Eclipse Public License. It brings code coverage analysis directly into the Eclipse workbench:

* Fast develop/test cycle: Launches from within the workbench like JUnit test runs can directly be analyzed for code coverage.
* Rich coverage analysis: Coverage results are immediately summarized and highlighted in the Java source code editors.
* Non-invasive: EclEmma does not require modifying your projects or performing any other setup.

The update site for EclEmma is http://update.eclemma.org/. EclEmma is also available via the Eclipse Marketplace Client, simply search for "EclEmma".

## Features

Currently the following launch types are supported:

* Local Java application
* Eclipse/RCP application
* Equinox OSGi framework
* JUnit test
* TestNG test
* JUnit plug-in test
* JUnit RAP test
* SWTBot test
* Scala application

## Analysis

On request or after your target application has terminated code coverage information is automatically available in the Eclipse workbench:

* Coverage overview: The Coverage view lists coverage summaries for your Java projects, allowing drill-down to method level.
* Source highlighting: The result of a coverage session is also directly visible in the Java source editors. A customizable color code highlights fully, partly and not covered lines. This works for your own source code as well as for source attached to instrumented external libraries.

Additional features support analysis for your test coverage:

* Different counters: Select whether instructions, branches, lines, methods, types or cyclomatic complexity should be summarized.
* Multiple coverage sessions: Switching between coverage data from multiple sessions is possible.
* Merge Sessions: If multiple different test runs should be considered for analysis coverage sessions can easily be merged.
