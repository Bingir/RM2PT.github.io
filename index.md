### Introduction

**RM2PT** is a CASE tool for automatically prototype generation from a requirements model in UML diagrams complemented by formal contracts of system operations. Compared with other tools, our approach does not require design models but rely on a requirements model, which contains:

* `A use case diagram`
* `System sequence diagrams`
* `Contracts of system operations`
* `A conceptual class diagram`  

The evaluation result from four case studies shows that our approach can correctly generate 93.65% code from requirements models, the remaining non-executable 6.35% requirements can be recognized and wrapped as an interface, which can be manually implemented or matched with third-party APIs libraries.
